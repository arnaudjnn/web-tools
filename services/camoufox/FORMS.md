# Single-attempt forms

`web_form_submit` (Tools API) delegates to Camoufox `/form-submit`. Domain
selectors and business validation stay with the consumer. The browser service
owns navigation, required-field filling, isolated cookies, cleanup and a
context-wide one-POST guard. It lets the page's own submit handler run; it does
not supply CAPTCHA answers or promise provider acceptance.

Version 2 adds `contract_version: 2`, `form_submissions: 0 | 1`, and nullable
`error`. `status` is the actual matching POST response, not the initial GET.
`submission_urls` optionally names same-origin POST endpoints sharing the same
budget (defaults to `url`; query strings are ignored). `ok` requires one POST,
a 2xx/3xx response and a matching `success_url`.

Required field errors prevent the click. Form jobs never use the read-only
browser recovery/retry wrapper. Their deadline starts before queueing; expired
jobs cannot later start a form submission. Browser contexts block service
workers so form requests remain visible to interception.

This is not cross-request idempotency: callers must persist their operation or
identity reservation BEFORE sending the HTTP request. A lost response or 502
means unknown, never zero submissions or permission to replay. Do not add a
generic HTTP retry policy to this endpoint. Site rejections are returned as
page content for the caller to interpret. Neither fields nor exception payloads
are logged by the form runner.

Tests (only our loopback fixture receives submissions):

```
python -m unittest discover -s services/camoufox -p 'test_form*.py' -v
FORM_BROWSER_TEST=chromium python -m unittest discover -s services/camoufox -p 'test_form*.py' -v
```

The browser test also supports `FORM_BROWSER_TEST=camoufox` in the deployed
image. Deploy Camoufox and Tools before a consumer requiring contract version 2.
