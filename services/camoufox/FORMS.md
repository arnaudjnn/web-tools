# Single-attempt forms

`web_form_submit` (Tools API) delegates to Camoufox `/form-submit`. Domain
selectors and business validation stay with the consumer. The browser service
owns navigation, required-field filling, isolated cookies, cleanup and a
context-wide one-POST guard. It lets the page's own submit handler run; it does
not supply CAPTCHA answers or promise provider acceptance.

Version 2 adds `contract_version: 2`, `form_submissions: 0 | 1`, and nullable
`error`. `status` is the actual matching POST response, not the initial GET.
`submission_urls` optionally names same-origin POST endpoints sharing the same
budget (defaults to `url`; query strings are ignored). `ok` requires one POST,
a 2xx/3xx response and a matching `success_url`.

Required field errors prevent the click. Form jobs never use the read-only
browser recovery/retry wrapper. Their deadline starts before queueing; expired
jobs cannot later start a form submission. Browser contexts block service
workers so form requests remain visible to interception.

This is not cross-request idempotency: callers must persist their operation or
identity reservation BEFORE sending the HTTP request. A lost response or 502
means unknown, never zero submissions or permission to replay. Do not add a
generic HTTP retry policy to this endpoint. Site rejections are returned as
page content for the caller to interpret. Neither fields nor exception payloads
are logged by the form runner.

`diagnostics` contains passive CAPTCHA script request/response counts, failing
HTTP statuses, network/page-script error counts, whether the submit click was
attempted, and nullable `token_present`. Token presence inspects only the first
outgoing form POST (`captcha_field`, default `g-recaptcha-response`); diagnostics
never include tokens, request bodies, query strings or exception messages.
A token's presence does NOT prove validity, action, score or server acceptance.
Likewise, a loaded script does not prove its handler ran. No solver is installed.

`inspect_only: true` navigates without filling or clicking and blocks same-origin
mutating requests. It returns no HTML and never reports form success. Use this
to check script delivery without consuming a mailbox or creating an account.
It cannot measure a token generated only on submit: `token_present` stays null.

Tests (only our loopback fixture receives submissions):

```
python -m unittest discover -s services/camoufox -p 'test_form*.py' -v
FORM_BROWSER_TEST=chromium python -m unittest discover -s services/camoufox -p 'test_form*.py' -v
```

The browser test also supports `FORM_BROWSER_TEST=camoufox` in the deployed
image. Deploy Camoufox and Tools before a consumer requiring contract version 2.
